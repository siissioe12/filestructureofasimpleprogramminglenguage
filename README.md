# file_structure_of_a_simple_programming_lenguage
This is the file structure of a simple programming lenguage.

In the lexer, parser, interpreter, main and tests I created .rs (rust files), however you can use any other lenguage you like. The file in the main directory that is called "Cargo.toml" is for compiling rust, if you will not use rust, then you might delete it. 
There are some files that ends with the extension:".mylenguageextension". You might want to change it.
Does not have a compiler
